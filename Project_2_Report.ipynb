    "Now that we have loaded the data into pyspark, we can now transform our intial data to create queryable dataframes. In this part, we will create 3 different data tables; assessments, scores, and questions. For the first data table, we want to create a table that contains some of the external Json layer information. This only requires the simplest transformation. With the following line of code, we can unroll the data to expose the outermost values (will still have nesting in sequences, so we can't use these values in the table). We can then register and name our data table as a temporary table \"assessments\" which we can later run SQL queries against.\n",

    "\n",
    "unroll_assessments.registerTempTable('assessments')\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, we will create the scores table. When we look at the structure of the nested Json and what fields we may be interested to act upon, we can see that in the nested sequence there are counts of questions, and the number of correct questions. We will take these two fields (and combine them to make a percent column that represents the percentage of correct answers for the test) and the name of the exam for analysis. The below code will use the function lambda_scores (for the construction of this function see SparkCode.ipynb) to unroll the Json data in this manner and save the result as a temporary table \"scores\".\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_scores = assessments.rdd.flatMap(lambda_scores).toDF()\n",
    "\n",
    "my_scores.registerTempTable('scores')\n",

    "Finally, we will also create a questions table. Within the nesting in sequences there is a nested list called questions. Within the data for each question is a unique question identifier. Using this question id, along with a sequence id (pertains to the sequence of questions), user id, exam name, and question number we can create a new table questions. We will use the function lambda_questions to do so (built in SparkCode.ipynb) and will save the result as a temporary table \"questions\".\n",

    "Now that we have temporary tables saved we can go ahead and run SQL queries against them. This will let us answer some simple business questions and think about what we can use the tables for. There are three business questions that will be answered in this part:\n",

    "1) How many people took each exam?\n",
    "\n",
    "2) What is the average and standard deviation of scores on all exams?\n",

    "\n",
    "The first question can be answered using the \"assessments\" table. When we look at the assessments table, we can see a pretty glaring issue. The sequence column in this table has nested values, which means that we won't be able to use this (or anything inside) for querying from this table. However, when we look at our first business question, we can see that we won't need to use this. To answer the question of how many people took each exam, we use the spark sql statement below.\n",
    "```\n",
    "spark.sql(\"select count(*), exam_name from assessments group by exam_name\").show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will give us a table of two columns: exam_name and count. Now, if we want to know how many people took an assessment, we can just look at this output, or we could even make the sql even more specific to get the numbers for a specific exam. We find ranges for our table from 1 person taking the assessment to 394 people taking \"Learning Git\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question asks for the average and standard deviation of scores on all exams. We can use our created table \"scores\" to answer this question. In the making of \"scores\", we throw away any observations that don't have data on the total number of questions or the number of correct questions since artificially inserting 0's would change our totals for these values. Using the below code, we can run a spark sql queries to answer our question.\n",
    "```\n",
    "spark.sql(\"select avg(percent) from scores\").show()\n",
    "spark.sql(\"select stddev(percent) from scores\").show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "We find that the average over all exams with data is 62.66 percent with a standard deviation of 31.09 percent. This could be informative if we are looking to see how difficult the exams are on average. We could also modify the queries (groupby exam_name) to see the scores on each test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the third question asks for the id's of the questions for a given user_exam_id. This could help us to investigate a particular individual to get some sort of information about their circumstances. This can then be performed by the following code (with the user_exam_id being a an example).\n",
    "```\n",
    "spark.sql(\"select * from questions where user_exam_id == '6d4089e4-bde5-4a22-b65f-18bce9ab79c8'\").show()\n",
